/**
 * Problem Set 4.
 * 
 * It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on using
 * iterative control structures. The `main` method is done for you. Lines 30-39
 * trigger each of the predefined methods, which you can think of as self-contained
 * executable pieces of logic. Write your code for each exercise in the
 * corresponding method.
 * 
 * The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Your job is to write
 * lines of code to produce answers to my questions. Each exercise requires that
 * you ask the user to enter one or more values. Your code must meet the
 * requirements set forth in this section (as well as the *Deliverables* section).
 * 
 * Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask
 * questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.
